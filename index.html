        <h2>About Call of Duty</h2>
        <p>Call of Duty CoD is one of the most popular and enduring video game franchises in the world, renowned for its immersive first-person shooter gameplay. Developed by Infinity Ward and later expanded by studios such as Treyarch, Sledgehammer Games, and others, the series debuted in 2003. Initially set in the backdrop of World War II, it offered players an intense and cinematic experience that stood out from other shooters of the time. Over the years, the series evolved, moving to modern and futuristic warfare settings with entries like *Modern Warfare* and *Black Ops*, captivating millions with its gripping storylines, fluid mechanics, and stunning visuals.
            The franchise's multiplayer mode is a major draw, featuring fast-paced gameplay, customizable loadouts, and competitive matches that have kept players engaged for decades. From iconic maps like *Nuketown* to game modes such as *Team Deathmatch* and *Battle Royale* in *Warzone*, CoD has continuously innovated its multiplayer offerings. Its progression systems, including prestige ranks and seasonal updates, ensure players have constant goals to strive for. The rise of *Call of Duty: Esports* has also contributed to its popularity, fostering a vibrant competitive scene and tournaments like the Call of Duty League (CDL).
            Another notable aspect of CoD is its *Zombies* mode, first introduced in *Call of Duty: World at War*. This cooperative mode tasks players with surviving waves of increasingly difficult zombie hordes, complete with intricate storylines, puzzles, and easter eggs. It became a beloved staple in the series, particularly in the *Black Ops* subseries. Over time, Call of Duty has expanded its reach with mobile versions and free-to-play entries like *Call of Duty: Warzone*, ensuring its relevance across platforms and generations. With each installment, CoD continues to push the boundaries of storytelling, innovation, and player engagement in the gaming industry.</p>

        <h2>How to Play and Tips</h2>
        <h3>Beginner Tips</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Master Your Loadout: In Call of Duty, customizing your loadout is crucial for success. Experiment with different weapons, perks, and attachments to find what suits your playstyle. For example, if you prefer close-range combat, opt for SMGs and perks like Lightweight to move faster. For long-range engagements, sniper rifles with thermal scopes and perks like Ghost can give you the edge. Always adapt your loadout to the map and game mode you’re playing..</li>
            <li>Map Awareness and Movement: Knowing the map is one of the best ways to improve your gameplay. Pay attention to choke points, high-traffic areas, and potential sniper spots. Use this knowledge to anticipate enemy movements and avoid running into ambushes. Additionally, mastering movement techniques like slide canceling, jump shots, and bunny hopping can make you harder to hit and give you the upper hand in gunfights..</li>
            <li>Team Communication and Objective Play: In team-based modes, communication can make or break your chances of winning. Use your mic or in-game pings to share enemy locations and coordinate strategies. Remember, in objective-based modes like Domination or Search and Destroy, playing for the objective is more important than chasing kills. Prioritize teamwork and smart positioning to secure victories..</li>
        </ul>
       
        <h3>Advanced Tips</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Master the art of "pre-aiming" at common choke points.</li>
            <li>Use grenades to flush out enemies from hiding spots.</li>
